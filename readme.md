# Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator application built with HTML, styled with CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to capture different inputs evaluated by the [math.js library](https://mathjs.org/index.html). This was one of the first projects I ever created when I was first learning web development back around 2018 and thus I used the technologies I knew at the time. Unfortunately, the original version of this app had really outdated, bad code, and I didn't really use good practices when I built it. This could be considered version 2.0 of this app. This version includes additional keyboard functionality, error catching, and more.

## How to use this application

This application works similarly to any other calculator app. Inputs can be added to the calculation field either through the buttons on the calculator table or through pressing the corresponding symbols on the keyboard (including the C key for clear). The application can evaluate virtually any valid mathematical equation. Any invalid input will be removed and classified as an error. A message will appear above the calculator informing you as much.
